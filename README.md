# Vitt

Vitt is hackable plain text double-entry accounting system inspired by [ledger](https://ledger-cli.org/) and follows the [plain text accounting](https://plaintextaccounting.org/) philosophy.

> Plain text accounting is a way of doing bookkeeping and accounting with plain text files and scriptable, command-line-friendly software based on readable, version-controllable, future-proof plain text files.

Advantages of using plain text files for accounting:

- Fast, lightweight and free from vendor lock-in.
- Local and privacy friendly, not cloud-based. Your private financial data remains under your control.
- Scripting-friendly and automatable.
